## What is this?

This is a configuration for Neovim. It's written in Lua, and uses modern plugins like Treesitter & Telescope. It also implements the native Neovim LSP. It's very fast, good looking, and has a lot of nice features.

## Prerequisites

- [Neovim 0.9 or above](https://neovim.io)

## Setup quick.nvim

### 1. Download configuration

#### Clone repository

If you want to receive updates as this configuration gets patched, then clone this repository into your `.config` directory, or wherever you keep your current Neovim configuration.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:albingroen/quick.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

#### Releases

On the other hand, if you want a raw folder with the configuration files, without git connected to it, you can head over to the releases page, and download a release from there.

https://github.com/albingroen/quick.nvim/releases

### 2. Install plugins

To install the plugins used by quick.nvim, you need to do so using Lazy.

```
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

```
:Lazy sync
```

### Install ripgrep

In order for the Telescope live_grep functionality to work, you need to have ripgrep installed on your machine. Please reference the official ripgrep installation options, but if run Homebrew, you can install it like this.

### Install LSP servers, formatters and linters

You can install anything you want by running `:Mason`. Here are a few that I usually install.

- emmet-language-server emmet_language_server
- eslint-lsp eslint
- stylua
- typescript-language-server tsserver

```
brew install rg
```
