## What is this?

This is a configuration for Neovim. It's written in Lua, and uses modern
plugins like Treesitter & Telescope. It also implements the native Neovim LSP.
It's very fast, good looking, and has a lot of nice features.

## Prerequisites


- [Neovim 0.9 or above](https://neovim.io)

### Recommended terminal setup

[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/) with the [following
configuration](https://github.com/albingroen/dotfiles/tree/main/kitty)

## Setup quick.nvim

### 1. Download configuration

#### Clone repository

If you want to receive updates as this configuration gets patched, then clone
this repository into your `.config` directory, or wherever you keep your
current Neovim configuration.

```sh git clone git@github.com:albingroen/quick.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim ```

#### Releases

On the other hand, if you want a raw folder with the configuration files,
without git connected to it, you can head over to the releases page, and
download a release from there.

https://github.com/albingroen/quick.nvim/releases

### 2. Install plugins

To install the plugins used by quick.nvim, you need to do so using Lazy.

``` nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua ```

``` :Lazy sync ```

### Install ripgrep

In order for the Telescope live_grep functionality to work, you need to have
ripgrep installed on your machine. Please reference the official ripgrep
installation options, but if run Homebrew, you can install it like this.

``` brew install rg ```

### Install LSP servers, formatters and linters

You can install anything you want by running `:Mason`. Here are a few that I
usually install.

- emmet-language-server emmet_language_server
- eslint-lsp eslint
- stylua
- typescript-language-server tsserver
