## What is this?

This is a configuration for Neovim. It's written in Lua, and uses modern
plugins like Treesitter, Telescope, and Lualine. It does however not implement
the native Neovim LSP. It's very fast, good looking, and has a lot of nice
features.

## Setup quick.nvim

### 1. Download configuration

#### Clone repository

If you want to receive updates as this configuration gets patched, then clone
this repository into your `.config` directory, or wherever you keep your
current Neovim configuration.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tommytim0515/quick.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

#### Releases

On the other hand, if you want a raw folder with the configuration files,
without git connected to it, you can head over to the releases page, and
download a release from there.

https://github.com/albingroen/quick.nvim/releases

### 2. Install plugins

#### Install Packer

quick.nvim uses [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as its
Neovim plugin manager.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

To install the plugins used by quick.nvim, you need to do so using Packer.

```
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

```
:PackerInstall
```

PS. If you're having trouble running `:PackerInstall` after this, please follow the instructions in this issue: https://github.com/albingroen/quick.nvim/issues/2

### Install ripgrep

In order for the Telescope live_grep functionality to work, you need to have
ripgrep installed on your machine. Please reference the official ripgrep
installation options, but if run Homebrew, you can install it like this.

```
brew install rg
```

## coc.nvim

This configuration uses [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for
intellisense, instead of the built-in Neovim LSP. This is because I think it's
not quite mature yet, pretty tricky to configure, and doesn't have a quite as
many languages and frameworks supported.

quick.nvim doesn't ship with any default coc plugins though, so you have to
install the ones you want to use. For example if you want to use quick.nvim for
TypeScript programming, you'll have to install the coc-tsserver plugin like
this.

```
:CocInstall coc-tsserver
```
